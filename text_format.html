        Good afternoon, Sir.
        First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. I’m truly excited to be here.
        My name is Pruthviraj More, and I am from Pune. I have recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Dr. D.Y. Patil College.
        During my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in technology and programming. I have gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C language, and basic Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy solving problems and building simple web pages, which helps me to strengthen my logical thinking.
        I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, and I’m always eager to explore new technologies and apply them in real-world scenarios.
        Once again, thank you for the opportunity.
    </p>
