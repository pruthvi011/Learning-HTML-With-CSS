            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Hello Everyone!
                My name is Pruthviraj More, and I am from Pune. I have recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Dr. D.Y. Patil College.
                During my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in technology and programming. I have gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C language, and basic Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy solving problems and building simple web pages, which helps me to strengthen my logical thinking.
                I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, and I’m always eager to explore new technologies and apply them in real-world scenarios.

            <h1>My Sunday Routine</h1>
            <p>
                Good morning everyone,
                Today I would like to talk about my Sunday routine.
                Sunday is a special day for me because it gives me a break from my regular weekday schedule. I usually wake up a little later than usual, around 8 or 9 AM. The first thing I do is freshen up and enjoy a hot cup of tea or coffee. I like to keep my Sundays relaxing and refreshing.
                After that, I spend some time with my family. We usually have breakfast together and sometimes plan something fun, like watching a movie or going out for a short trip. If we stay at home, I help my parents with a few household chores.
                In the afternoon, I take some time for myself. I either read a book, listen to music, or sometimes take a short nap. Sundays are also great for catching up on any pending studies or assignments, but I try not to stress too much.
                In the evening, I often go out with friends or take a walk in the nearby park. It feels nice to be outside and enjoy the fresh air. Sometimes we play a sport like cricket or just sit and talk.
                Finally, I end my day with a light dinner and prepare for the coming week. I check my schedule, pack my bag, and go to bed a bit early so I can start Monday fresh and energetic. <br>
                That’s all about my Sunday routine. Thank you!
